# DeadlyBlue
This is a Minecraft spigot plugin

If you really wanna download the source code and make changes. This is an eclipse project.

You can [migrate the project into intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-from-eclipse-page-1.html#open-eclipse-project) if you prefer

## Version
1.0

I will update in the future

## Description
Native Version is 1.18. 
But it works on 1.18.2
